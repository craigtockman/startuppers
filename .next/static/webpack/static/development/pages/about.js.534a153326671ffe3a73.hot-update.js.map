Ever since I\n          created the word \"startupers\" in 2006 I've been teased, harassed, and\n          generally annoyed by people that believe the word should be spelled\n          with 2 \"p\"s\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Here is a prime example{' '}\n          <a\n            href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/startuper#English'\n            target='_blank'\n          >\n            from the Wikipedia\n          </a>\n          .\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Often when I was confronted with this dispute I would ask, \"Why should\n          it have 2 \"p\"s ?\"\n        </p>\n        <p>\"Because the word \"upper\" has 2 'p's\", they would say.</p>\n        <p>\n          Where I would then ask, \"Based on that line of thinking how many \"p\"s.\n          does the word startup have?\"\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          In responce they would kindly say, \"Excuse me but I need to go get\n          another drink before this shit bar closes.\"\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Hopefully you see my point. Many don't. Therefore, after many years of\n          waiting and way too much money, we were finally able to purchase from\n          an internet troll this domain as an attempt to end this dispute.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          So, since I created the word in San Francisco, in a moment of\n          inspiration in 2006 while daydreaming in the basement of a hotel, here\n          is my official definition: Which is also in dispute{' '}\n          <a\n            href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/startupper#English'\n            target='_blank'\n          >\n            by a very annoying person here.\n          </a>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong>\n            <i>startupers</i>\n          </strong>{' '}\n          (singular startuper) (neologism) People who are enthusiastic about the\n          formation, creation, and participation in startup business ventures.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n      <style jsx>\n        {`\n          p {\n            font-size: 20px;\n            line-height: 26px;\n            margin: 0 0 20px;\n          }\n        `}\n      </style>\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AACA;AAFA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAQA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AACA;AAFA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAnDA;AAAA;AAAA;AAoEA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
